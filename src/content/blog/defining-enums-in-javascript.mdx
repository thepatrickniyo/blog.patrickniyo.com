## How to define enums in Javascipt

<p>
  <b>Enumerations</b> offer an easy way to work with sets of related constants.
  <b>An enumeration</b>, or <b>Enum</b> , is a symbolic name for a set of values.
  Enumerations are treated as data types, and you can use them to create sets of
  constants for use with variables and properties.
</p>

<p>
  Natively javascript doesn't support <b>enums</b> but still you can implement
  enum in javascipt. One of the available ways is to defining an object and then
  freezing it after definition.
  <b>A frozen</b> object can not be modified or you can not add other properties
  after definition and it's values can not be changed/modified. This keeps the <b>enumeration idea</b>
</p>

## Syntax to create an enum in javascipt

```js
 const daysEnum = {
      MON:1,
      TUE:2,
      WED:3,
      THUR:4,
      FRI:5,
      SAT:6
      SUN:7
    };

 Object.freeze(daysEnum);
```

## How to access values

<p>
  To be able to access 7 as the seventh day of the week using our difined{' '}
  <b>enum</b>, here is the syntax
</p>

```js
let value = daysEnum.SUN; // 7
```
