## [Solved] Resolving Password authentication is temporarily disabled as part of a brownout. Please use a personal access token instead.

If you're trying to run `git push origin main` or basically accessing your remote git and you get the bellow error this blog is for you to get it resolved

### error

```js
remote: Password authentication is temporarily disabled as part of a brownout. Please use a personal access token instead.

remote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-07-30-token-authentication-requirements-for-api-and-git-operations/ for more information.

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/PatrickNiyogitare28/please-golf-api.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

### Why that error

Git since 30/06/2021 git basic password authentication in gitbush or git CLI is deplicated and it's no longer working.
You can read more on this [here](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/)

### How to resolve

Let's see how you can quickly get this resolved in the simplest way so that you can keep working.

- [x] [Create your github access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- [x] Update the
  ```shell
  $ git remote origin url
  ```
  to use token

Feel free to jump that step **creating access token** if you have already created your github access token

> Note that you don't need to create a new access token for each project, It will depend on previlages you need to include in the access token

1. Remove remote origin
   ```shell
   $ git remote remove origin
   ```
2. Reset the remote origin including **_your token you created_**
   ```shell
   $ git remote add origin https://<token>@<git_url>.git
   ```

Now you are good to go
